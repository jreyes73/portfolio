            <section id="about-me-text-1">
                <p>Hi! I'm Julian. First of all, I really appreciate you visiting my site so I hope I am able to provide with some useful information. I have spent the last 11 years living in Seoul, South Korea; originally as an English teacher and most recently as a content developer for an education company. It was during my time as a content developer that I became enthralled by creating content and projects digitally. As a content developer, I created interactive lessons, designed curriculums, authored textbooks for young learners. While creating educational content was an experience that I will cherish for a long time, I knew that I still wasn't reaching my highest potential.</p>
                <p>After briefly exploring graphic design, I discovered software development. A couple of years ago, I would have never imagined pursuing a career as software developer, since I had only really knew how to use the most common programs (Chrome, Word, PowerPoint, - I had only recently learned the Adobe programs) After all this, is coming from a guy that wanted to create his own digital board but could only make a prototype on PowerPoint since I hadn't had a clue of how to write a single line of code. I have now been on my coding journey since summer 2023, and I have enjoyed every second (even the frustrating times) of learning through Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineering career path.</p>

            <section id="about-me-text-2">
                <p>With each day of learning, my confidence is growing. I am looking to complete the program in the next few months and as I do that I have been working on side projects to further solidify my new skills. Some of those projects include this portfolio website, a template resume website (to potentially offer as a service), and my board game idea. I am looking for as much experience and practice as possible so that I am eventually able to fully make a career switch to either a front-end developer or maybe a full-stack developer. I know that with regular practice and dedication, I will reach my goal and all the late nights studying will eventually pay off.</p>
                <p>With that being said, I hope that this website will showcase my current skills and my passion for software development. While I will acknowledge that I have a long way to go, I also see that I have come a long way. And for those that are considering a career in software development or even making a career switch, I would like to refer you to the quote by Greek philosopher, Epictetus - "First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do." It's a quote that I find rather relatable, because while I didn't know a thing about coding before I started my journey, I did know that I could reach my goal if I set my mind to it. So please, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or inquries. </p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Portfolio Website</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This Portfolio Website is my first major project. This site contains the work that displays my abilities in web developement and front-end development. You can find a brieft self-introduction, projects, my skills, and my contact information on this site. Feel free to explore and click on the various interactive links and buttons. Additionally, you can resize the broswer's window to scrutinize the responsiveness of the site.</p>
            <p>As for the design of this site, I decided to try something a bit different from what I am used to. Normally, when styling boxes, I like to have rounded edges and blurry shadow effects. Here, you can see I went with sharp corners and more defined shadows. I have seen this done on Codecademy's website and it has really grown on me. Lastly, I think the simple color scheme that I went with makes for a more modern look.</p>
            <p>Oh, one more thing... I expect I can keep this updated sort of like a living document. I want update my profile to include new projects.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">+ Resume Website</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>As a side project, I have also created a Resume Website. While it shares some similarities with the Portfolio Website, there are some obvious differences. The Resume website works much like a typical website and provides my education and work history, the Portfolio Website focuses on my coding projects. I hope to use both to provide to potential employers.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I am also hoping that the Resume Website could work as a template of sorts, in order to provide a paid service for teachers or any other person interested in a resume website. I feel this approach could be profitable since resume websites are less common and could help someone standout in an interview process.</p>

            <p>Here is one of the first webpages that I published on GitHub. I created as part of one the projects in Codecademy to practice making responsive sites. While most of the content is fictious, it was based on my interest for investing so I especially had fun making that simple site. </p>

            <p>While both, hard skills and soft skills are crucial in today's world. I would argue soft skills are more important since employers want workers that they can trust to get any job thats demanded. Here, are my top softs skills.</p>
            <p>During interviews, I emphasize the first soft skill listed below, "Adaptability," since I am will will (and I embrace) new and uncomfortable situations, because I know it's those types of situations that will help me grow as a worker and person.</p>
